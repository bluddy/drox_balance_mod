- Items:
  - heavy: weapons, weak weapons (lower requirements), shields, hull, fighters
  - medium: inner utilities, power, thrust
  - light: crew, crew equipment (uses power)
  - Need to change npctypes.gdb to give the right things in the right slots
- Reduce stat points from crew equipment
- Requirements have to be lowered (done?)
- For starters, add more available slots at lower levels.
- Add copies of items that only use levels, but are weaker. This makes it so you have options and can invest points in whatever you want.
  - Only need it for must-have items:
    weak power plants
    weak weapons
- Problem is, no matter what, you feel ineffective.
  - Only way to make that go away is by stacking multiple weapons.
  - But that requires a lot of upgrades in command (need power plant, thrust, 2 heavy weapons)
- ** Regen on shields is far too slow to mean anything. Might as well get just armor.
  - Only advantage is from ancient recharge stations.
- In most space sims, shields are your only defense, and armor is when you start taking real damage.
  - Armor costs no power. Huge advantage.
  - Might as well recharge it with healing (not available in most space games).
  - Make healing items not repair armor

- Make certain drox quests give fewer legend points
- More energy for swarm missiles
- Mines should be heavy -- too strong

- Can we make giant nebulas that have effects?
  - Check that purple electric field thing
  - Radiation storm. Projectile.
  - Could add storms that are healing, have other effects (stealth)
  - See black hole for status effect
- Can we make anomalies happen automatically?
  - Currently chests. Could change into traps.
- Can we reduce mines, or place them in mine fields?
  - Mine fields already exist
  - Can reduce spawn chance of random mines
  - Or make them only spawn in fields

- Fighters
  - Give summoned status effect from Din's
  - More health, more punch
  - MonsterStatusEffect allows for other passive skills (items) that boost monsters
     for pet builds

- Need to radically reduce effect of command
  - Too many slots
  - Almost always effective to pile on weapons and armor

- Race manipulation needs to be cheap enough to do it for many planets
- Skill tree per race   

- Nebula
  - Cannot take away energy: not fair. doesn't apply to monsters
