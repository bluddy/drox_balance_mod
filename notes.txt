- Items:
  - heavy: weapons, weak weapons (lower requirements), shields, hull, fighters
  - medium: inner utilities, power, thrust
  - light: crew, crew equipment (uses power)
  - Need to change npctypes.gdb to give the right things in the right slots
- Reduce stat points from crew equipment

- Can we make giant nebulas that have effects?
  - Check that purple electric field thing
  - Radiation storm. Projectile.
  - Could add storms that are healing, have other effects (stealth)
  - See black hole for status effect
- Can we make anomalies happen automatically?
  - Currently chests. Could change into traps.
- Can we reduce mines, or place them in mine fields?
  - Mine fields already exist
  - Can reduce spawn chance of random mines
  - Or make them only spawn in fields

- Fighters
  - Give summoned status effect from Din's
  - More health, more punch
  - MonsterStatusEffect allows for other passive skills (items) that boost monsters
     for pet builds

- Need to radically reduce effect of command
  - Too many slots
  - Almost always effective to pile on weapons and armor
